      <talk_question mid="10"><![CDATA[<html>$Duke Stewart$<BR>It's difficult to strike a balance of both. You can try to Govern neutrally, but it will inevitably end up lop-sided.

      <talk_question mid="11"><![CDATA[<html>$Duke Stewart$<BR>You're stupid. This is about governace. A man can be nice or bad. But the act of a group is bit dependant on rational logic. So, dealing with individuals is different from governing. I didn't think you would understand the difference.</html>]]></talk_question>

Here comes an idealist? They can act vicious when they're in a group even though they are usually nice people. Dynasty considers people as a group. Even foolish people seem to know it by instinct and they take advantage of it. They can cause huge trouble and you tell me to let them live freely? Stop that nonsense.</html>]]></talk_question>

      <talk_question mid="13"><![CDATA[<html>$Duke Stewart$<BR>
Yes, it's difficult to find the balance between fear and admiration. It's wise sometimes to divide the public perception into a good king and a bad adviser. His Majesty will rule here, and I'll act as the bad advisor. But His Majesty has a lot to learn and prepare before he rules.</html>]]></talk_question>
