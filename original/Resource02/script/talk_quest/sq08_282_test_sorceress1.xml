      <qdesc>15레벨이 된 소서리스
티아나와 대화로 퀘스트를 시작한다.

티아나에게 말을 걸면, 마나리지의 소서리스 타라가 초급 소서리스 시험을 치기 위해서 오고 있으니, 수정개울로 마중을 가라고 한다. 티아나는 소서리스를 보고 당연히 너도 초급시험 정도는 치러겠지라고 묻는다.

그러나 소서리스는 질풍노도의 유년기를 보내느라 초급시험조차 치르지 못했다.
과거의 비행들을 떠올리며 아련한 감회에 젖는 소서리스.
티아나는 우물쭈물하지 말고 후배 마중을 가라고 다그치고, 소서리스는 타라를 마중하러 간다.

소서리스 타라는 이미 수정개울에 도착해 있었다.
타라는 오랜만에 뵙는다고 인사를 하고, 자신도 드디어 초급 소서리스 시험을 치르게 되었다고 좋아한다. 

"선배같은 천재에게는 초급시험을 패스하는 건, 식은 죽 먹기로 쉬웠겠죠? 하지만 전 정말 이 시험을 위해서 오랫동안 준비를 해왔답니다. 시험 준비를 위해서 이론서뿐 아니라 많은 실전 훈련도 해왔어요. 이론 논술 시험을 위해서, 초급 시험 이후 소서리스들이 나아갈 길들에 대해서도 공부했는데 제가 암기한 것들을 테스트하는 걸 도와주시지 않으시겠어요?"

소서리스는 진땀을 흘리며, 타라와 1차 전직 클래스에 대한 질답을 한다.
틀린 질문을 하면 타라가 이상한 표정을 짓기 때문에, 재빨리 답을 수정하는 식으로 위기를 모면한다. 

타라는 질답이 끝나면 응용 시험에 대해서 말한다. 

"방금 전에 실전 시험을 통과했어요. 실전 시험은 비전의 방에서 마물들을 싸워 물리치는 것입니다."

타라에게 자극을 받은 소서리스는 후배에게 계속 잘난 척을 하기 위해서 자신도 초급 소서리스 시험을 치기로 한다. 그리고 타라에게 비전의 방의 위치를 묻는다. 미심쩍은 듯하단 표정을 짓는 타라. 소서리스는 다시 임기응변을 발휘해서 시련의 방으로 입장한다. (바보 타라)</qdesc>
