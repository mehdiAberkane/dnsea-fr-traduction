Mmm, I hate the point that they didn't act under the dynasty's control. I heard even Knight Velskud and Knight Teramai didn't follow the rules of Kingdom and Orders. Geraint only followed the rules.</html>]]></talk_question>

That's not too bad. Geraint was a quite good leader. If he were foolish and bad, the Dragon Slayers could have fallen to rioters.</html>]]></talk_question>

      <talk_question mid="13"><![CDATA[<html>$Duke Stewart$<BR>
I guess they could have acted more systematically and could have acted more helpful for the dynasty. After the Dragon Raid, it was shameful that they broke up. They could have remained as a more systematic organization if they were under the control of dynasty.</html>]]></talk_question>
