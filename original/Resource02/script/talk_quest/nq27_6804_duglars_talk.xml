I have lots of interest in hero Barnac. Even though he was a mercenary, he was also a warrior. Also he united the mercenary forces with his leadership. If he were alive, I would like to meet him. However, I had never heard from him for a long time. </html>]]></talk_question>

The rumour is after the dragon raid, he re-united the mercenary forces and left to find something. Many people are still wondering why and where he left to. </html>]]></talk_question>
