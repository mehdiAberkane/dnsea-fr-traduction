      <talk_question mid="10"><![CDATA[<html>$Adventurer's Guild Master Deckard$<BR>Some people believe that everything is already set. Even though a result comes from a certain rule, it's very rare that we put a value to it. A gamble is this. To choose one among many uncertain things and put a meaning to it. I can win or lose… I can't find any other things except gambling to find a meaning.</html>]]></talk_question>

Hmm, you seem like an idealist. Do you think you can save the world with justice alone? I'm sorry to say this but you can't work for it your whole life. You should think about your later years.</html>]]></talk_question>
